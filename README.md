Application Fact Sheet
======

This web application is a password meter/checker application for users to test how ‘strong’ their passwords are. This application can be used to test new and existing passwords using a scoring system as feedback, out of 4, 0 being the worst and 4 being the strongest. The user will enter a password into a input field with the option to hide/unhide passwords for privacy, users will then receive visual representations of their score with both on-screen meters and with ‘smart lights’ (Philips Hue Lights). Depending on how strong the entered password is, Hue Lights will display 1 of 5 patterns, ranking from “Very Weak” to “Very Strong”, each with a unique colour set to easily differentiate between scores. These ‘keys’ can be found under the Hue Lights page section with each having their own descriptions as to why the password entered received that score. This web application’s purpose is not only to test passwords but also to inform and provide advice as to how to create a more secure password with the use of tips and YouTube videos. 
This web application is stylised with well laid out diagrams and simple navigation.
